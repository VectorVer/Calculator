# Intro

Welcome,
  this is where you can find
  all the information on my Calculator
  project. 

# Read the versions

How to read the versions,
  to read the versions
  find "v" and look for
  the highest number.
  if you want an
  older model, find the
  lowest number.

# Schedule for new releases
  I try and release new versions
  as soon as I can, because I
  like to keep the Calculator up
  to date.
  
# Calculator V1.14
  Calculator V1.11 has
  dynamic buttons which
  fit to the tab size
  the answer area is
  also dynamic. V1.11
  now has brackets and
  follows the order of
  operations. Has Dynamic
  text. Buttons have been moved around.
